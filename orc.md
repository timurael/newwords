**Commit changes automatically, push only on command:**
- **Auto-commit**: Always commit changes after implementation
- **Controlled push**: Only push to GitHub when explicitly requested
- **Commit messages**: Follow established patterns with clear descriptions
- **Branch safety**: Work on appropriate branches, never force push
- **Backup strategy**: Use commits as restore points for rollback capability

```bash
# Standard workflow after each feature implementation:
git add src/ -A
git commit -m "Feature: [description]

## PROJECT-SPECIFIC PROTOCOLS

### WordMemory Architecture Patterns
1. **Feature-based Organization**: Group related components, hooks, and utilities
2. **Zustand Store Slices**: Modular state management with clear boundaries
3. **Component Composition**: Reusable UI primitives with proper prop interfaces
4. **Hook Abstractions**: Custom hooks for complex logic (useWordStudy, useFSRS)
5. **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript with proper error boundaries

### FSRS Implementation Standards
```typescript
// Always maintain these FSRS principles
interface FSRSImplementation {
  difficulty: number    // 1-10 scale
  stability: number     // Days until 90% retention
  retrievability: number // 0-1 probability of recall
  state: 'new' | 'learning' | 'review' | 'relearning'
}
```

### German Language Support
```typescript
// Enhanced German learning features
interface GermanWordFeatures {
  germanSentenceExample?: string
  verbForms?: {
    infinitive?: string
    pastTense?: string
    pastParticiple?: string
    presentTense?: string
    imperativeSingular?: string
    imperativePlural?: string
  }
  understandingContext?: string
}
```

### UI Component Standards
- **Accessibility First**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with proper breakpoints
- **Animation Guidelines**: Smooth 60fps animations, respect prefers-reduced-motion
- **Error States**: Comprehensive error boundaries and fallback UI

# If dev server stops, restart with:
npm run dev &

# Check if running:
curl -s http://localhost:3000 >/dev/null && echo "Server running" || echo "Server down"

# Monitor in background:
npm run dev 2>&1 | tee -a dev.log &
```

### Git Safety Protocol:
- **Never force push** without explicit user permission
- **Always commit before major changes** to enable rollback
- **Use descriptive commit messages** following established patterns
- **Check git status** before and after operations
- **Verify branch** before any git operations
